{"name":"Ordy' Sharks","slug":"Ordy' Sharks","supply":"100","description":"Ordy' Sharks is an art based collection of Ordinals ∞ inscribed into 100 satoshis on the ₿itcoin blockchain ∞\nThe story of our sharks is a tale of two parallel worlds, land and sea. Mans disregard for nature put the sharks in grave danger. In the late 20th century the shark population started coming back after years of hunting to near extinction. Their numbers quickly increased, yet the oceans had become littered with human trash to the point of extreme contamination. \n\nAmidst their desperation the sharks evolved to inhabit the land; as well as the sea in order to save their species. They began to thrive, adapted to breathing air and quickly influenced human culture. \n\nOrdinal Sharks celebrates this journey from sea to land. Sharks and their new human friends are now working together to clean up the oceans. Our project applauds these efforts and we look forward to the day sharks can permanently return to their ancestral sea homes with a new found respect for the planet.\n","twitter_link":"https://twitter.com/BakxCody","discord_link":"https://discord.gg/JsM6pZQGYD","website_link":"","inscription_icon":"https://ordinals.com/inscription/fb84eb01d5c0dca988305794266a76f1b0d1bde613252b00c7cbd9d0fa371d30i0"}
